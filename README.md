# URLEncodedForm
Parse and serialize url-encoded form data with Codable support.

## üôèüèª Notice
- This is an (En/De)coder that converts URL query item parameters to Codable.
- The original source has been modified to use the url-encoded-form created by [the Vapor team](https://github.com/vapor/url-encoded-form) through Foundation.

## Installation
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/interactord/URLEncodedForm", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## ‚úçüèª Usage

Regarding the usage, we plan to update it later.
